A girl sits at a wooden table by the window in a cozy café. She reaches out with her right hand, picks up the white coffee cup from the saucer, and gently brings it to her lips to take a sip.  After drinking, she places the cup back on the table and looks out the window, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. 
Then a man walks in and sits down at the table next to her. The man and the girl start to talk. 
The woman’s eyes soften as she listens, her expression calm and thoughtful. The man smiles faintly, speaking in slow, deliberate gestures. 
The man and the girl exchange glances, subtle yet familiar — the kind shared by people who have met before but haven’t seen each other in a while. 
The girl glances toward the window again; sunlight flickers across her face, highlighting the warmth in her expression. 
The man leans back slightly, resting his hand around his own cup, his movements relaxed. Steam rises between them, curling gently in the air, catching the morning light. 
A brief silence passes. The girl folds her hands on the table, her fingers brushing against a small silver spoon. She looks down for a moment, then back up, smiling softly. 
The man nods, a quiet understanding between them. Outside, a breeze stirs the trees, scattering a few fallen leaves across the windowpane. 
The café feels still — only the soft motion of their hands and the shifting light mark the passage of time. As the scene draws on, the camera slowly widens. 
The girl and the man remain absorbed in their quiet exchange — no words needed, only gestures, glances, and the gentle rhythm of morning light through glass.
